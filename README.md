**Jobless**

**Description**
---
Jobless is a web app coded with HTML, Foundation CSS framework, custom CSS, Javascript, and JQuery.  It utilizes APIs from careeronestop.org and a custom Google search engine.  Users find themselves on a landing page which has inputs for job/career title, city, state, and zipcode.  They can search by job title and any combination of location to get results.  When a successful search is performed, the user is presented with two columns of results.  One column lists 10 job postings from Indeed, Monster, or Ziprecruiter.  The other column returns the Bureau of Labor Statistics' job description, career outlook, and median salaries.  

These tools allow a job-seeker to compare salaries against the median, or have a starting salary in mind to increase their power during job negotiations.  It also speeds the career search by aggregating several job search tools together in order to get a more diverse set of results. Each job posting is a link that will take the user directly to the source post so they can apply and see additional details.

After searching, the user's previous search history is saved on the device and placed near the top of the page as a badge to facilitate repeat searches.

**Future Improvements**
---
In the future, we plan to integrate a second page that shows the BLS Career Finder tool, which helps users find potential careers that suit their skillsets.  We will also integrate another API through ONet to streamline the way the search engine handles inputs.
